## About ionic_integration

Integrating Fastlane with Ionic Generated Projects

Fastlane is an awesome application. However the assumption is that you are in control of the iOS or Android projects while using it. When developing in Ionic 
(or Cordova), the relevant platform projects are created for you by Ionic. For example **ionic platform add ios**

This poses a problem when attempting to automate the build process. We do not want to put the generated projects under source control, however we would like to 
be able to link it into fastlane??

This plugin will let you generate a sample UI Test group for generating snapshots the [fastlane way](https://tisunov.github.io/2015/11/06/automating-app-store-screenshots-generation-with-fastlane-snapshot-and-sketch.html). But it stores the UI Unit tests in your fastlane folder so that you can
commit only these to version control. The plugin, will then retrofit these tests into the Ionic/Cordova generated projects.

There are two actions (so far)
**ionic_ios_config_snapshot** get's you started with a sample UI Test configuration (and saves it to fastlane/ionic/config/ios/ui-tests). The UI Unit Tests
are linked into any existing XCode project generated by Ionic.

**ionic_ios_snapshot** Scans the fastlane/ionic/config/ios/ui-tests folder for sub folders that represent UI Test Schemes (each folder is a scheme). It retrofits 
each UI Test scheme into the XCode projects generated by Ionic. This should be executed before you perform [fastlane snapshot](https://github.com/fastlane/fastlane/tree/master/snapshot).

NOTE: At the moment this works for Xcode 8+. If anyone out there is interested in contributing, it would be great to support XCode 7 and (ideally) be able to do a 
similar thing for Android generated projects.

## Example

Check out the [example `Fastfile`](fastlane/Fastfile) to see how to use this plugin. Try it by cloning the repo, running `fastlane install_plugins` and `bundle exec fastlane test`.

### Before You Get Started
Xcode 8+ uses Team Id and Code Signing Identities. In order to get Ionic/Cordova projects to generate the correct values you can include a *build.json* file at the root of your iconic project. This file can then be supplied to the ionic build like so (using a build script you create):

```
ionic platform add ios 

ionic build ios --release --buildConfig=build.json
```

The json file is strutured like this:

```
{
  "ios": {
    "debug": {
      "developmentTeam": "XXXXXXXX",
      "codeSignIdentity": "iPhone Developer",
      "packageType": "development"
    },

    "release": {
      "developmentTeam": "XXXXXXX",
      "codeSignIdentity": "iPhone Developer",
      "packageType": "app-store"
    }
  }
}
```

Please refer to the [Cordova iOS Guide](https://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/latest/guide/platforms/ios/) for more details.

### Generating a Sample UI Test Scheme
To get started with a sample UI Unit Test Scheme, issue the following command:

fastlane run ionic_ios_config_snapshot ionic_scheme_name:"**[YOUR CHOSEN NAME]**"

For example: ```fastlane run ionic_ios_config_snapshot ionic_scheme_name:"ionic-screen-shots"```

*You can also specify which xcode project to use and minimum iOS version using **ionic_ios_xcode_path** and **ionic_min_target_ios** options respectively. The xcode project will be autodetected as the project (.xcodeproj) associated with the workspace (.xcworkspace) in platforms/ios folder generated by ionic/cordova*.

The command above will create a folder **fastlane/ionic/config/ios/ui-tests/ionic-screen-shots**

In this folder will be the standard test files that you would expect for a UI Unit Test, Info.plist, Fastlane SWIFT file and a sample Unit Test ui-snapshots.swift

**ionic_ios_config_snapshot** also executes the *ionic_config_snapshot* action to retrofit this unit test configuration into any existing XCode Project

When this is done. The sample will be linked into your generated project. In the above example, a UI Test scheme will be created in **fastlane/ionic/config/ios/ui-tests/ionic-screen-shots**. The files in this folder are linked absolutely into Xcode, that is Xcode refers directly to these files (they are not copied over to Xcode)

If you open up Xcode and open the file 'ionic-screen-shots/ui-snapshots.swift' you will see something like this:

```
    func testSnapshots() {

        //
        // Place your own tests here. This is a starter example to get you going..
        //
        snapshot("app-launch")
        
        // XCUIApplication().buttons["Your Button Name"].tap()
        
        // snapshot("after-button-pressed")
                
    }
```

In the XCode UI, select the scheme 'ionic-screen-shots' and click into the method 'testSnapshots()' (after the first snapshot).

You can now click on the 'Record UI Test' (Red Circle Icon).

This will open the simulator and you can click around in your application. XCode will record, each interaction within the 
testSnapshots() method.

When you are done, you can save everthing and it will save those interactions into the fastlane/ionic/config/ios/ui-tests/ui-snapshots.swift.

You can now add fastlane ```snapshot("decription")``` where you like.

This whole operation only needs to be done once (or if you want to add more screenshots later). 

The UI Test files can be added to your source control and they will be retrofitted into any future generated Ionic projects by the **ionic_ios_snapshot** action.

### Retrofitting UI Test Scheme via Fastlane

After you have created your first UI Test Scheme using ionic_ios_config_snapshot, you will now need to ensure the unit tests are retrofitted into the xcode project generated by ionic/cordova.

The **ionic_ios_snapshot** action can be executed before any other lane in your Fastfile by placing it in a [before_all](https://github.com/fastlane/fastlane/blob/master/fastlane/docs/Advanced.md) block.

The parameters for ionic_ios_snapshot action will mostly be autodetected. It attempts to pick the xcode project by looking in *platforms/ios* folder. The team_id parameter is automatically set if it is specified in your fastlane Appfile. The bundle_id is set automatically if the package_name parameter is set in your fastlane Appfile. All these parameters can be overridden by specifying them in the call to the action. To see what has been automatically picked up for your configuration, use ```fastlane action ionic_ios_snapshot```

**ionic_ios_snapshot** lists all the subfolders in the folder *fastlane/ionic/config/ios/ui-tests*. It then creates a UI Test Target and Scheme based on the name of the subfolder, in the example above, this would be a single target/scheme called *ionic-snap-shots*. It effectively 'retrofits' the UI tests into the iOS xcode project for you.

After ionic_ios_snapshot is executed, you can now specify any of the schemes you generated to be used in fastlane [snapshot](https://github.com/fastlane/fastlane/tree/master/snapshot) action, using the 'scheme' parameter.

Your fully automated Fastlane file can now look like this:

```ruby
platform :ios do

  before_all do
    #
    # This will retrofit any existing schemes in fastlane/ionic/config/ios/ui-tests/
    #
    ionic_ios_snapshot(
    	team_id: "[YOUR TEAM ID]"
    	bundle_id: "[YOUR APP BUNDLE ID]"
    )
  end

  lane :release do
  	# This will run the retrofitted UI Tests for you and create snapshots... :-)
  	snapshot(
      output_simulator_logs: true,
      reinstall_app: false,
      erase_simulator: true,
      scheme: "ionic-screen-shots" # The name of a scheme to use, one that you generated with ionic_ios_config_snapshot
    )
  end
end
```

You can now use this to fully automate the build process between ionic and fastlane, including snapshots.

There is also no limit to the number of different schemes you can create and use, so you could have one scheme for one lane and a whole different scheme for another lane.

## Run tests for this plugin
